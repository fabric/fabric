"""
Tests testing the publicly exposed test helper API.

Most of the testing module is tested via use in our own test suite, but
considering it's publicly-exposed code, we should have some dedicated tests to
it!

And thank goodness we're not using vanilla unittest/pytest or the word "test"
would be in here more than you can shake a buffalo at (see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)
