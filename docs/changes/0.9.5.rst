Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`37`: Internal refactoring of a Paramiko call from ``_transport`` to
  ``get_transport()``.
* :issue:`258`: Modify subprocess call on Windows platforms to avoid
  space/quote problems in `~fabric.operations.local`. Thanks to Henrik
  Heimbuerger and Raymond Cote for catch + suggested fixes.
* :issue:`261`: Fix bug in `~fabric.contrib.files.comment` which truncated
  regexen ending with ``$``.
* :issue:`264`: Fix edge case in `~fabric.operations.reboot` by gracefully
  clearing connection cache.
* :issue:`268`: Allow for ``@`` symbols in usernames, which is valid on some
  systems. Fabric's host-string parser now splits username and hostname at the
  last ``@`` found instead of the first.

Documentation updates
=====================

* :issue:`228`: Added description of the PyCrypto + pip + Python 2.5 problem to
  the documentation and removed the Python 2.5 check from ``setup.py``.
