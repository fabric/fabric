The following changes were implemented in Fabric 0.9.3:

Feature additions
=================

* N/A


Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`228`: We discovered that the pip + PyCrypto installation problem was
  limited to Python 2.5 only, and have updated our ``setup.py`` accordingly.
* :issue:`230`: Arbitrary or remainder commands (``fab <opts> -- <run command
  here>``) will no longer blow up when invoked with no fabfile present. Thanks
  to IRC user ``orkaa`` for the report.


Documentation updates
=====================

* :issue:`239`: Fixed typo in execution usage docs. Thanks to Pradeep Gowda and
  Turicas for the catch.
