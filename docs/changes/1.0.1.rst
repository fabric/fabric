========================
Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`189`: Added option ``--abort-on-prompt`` to abort instead of prompting
  for a password.
* :issue:`301`: Fixed a bug in `~fabric.operations.local`'s behavior when
  ``capture=False`` and ``output.stdout`` (or ``.stderr``) was also ``False``.
  Thanks to Chris Rose for the catch.
* :issue:`311`: `~fabric.contrib.files.append` was supposed to have its
  ``partial`` kwarg's default flipped from ``True`` to ``False``. However, only
  the documentation was altered. This has been fixed. Thanks to Adam Ernst for
  bringing it to our attention.

Documentation
=============

* Added a missing entry for :ref:`env.path <env-path>` in the usage
  documentation.
