======================
Changes in version 1.0
======================

This page lists all changes made to Fabric in its 1.0.0 release.


Highlights
==========

* Added functionality for loading fabfiles which are Python packages
  (directories) instead of just modules (single files). This allows for easier
  organization of nontrivial fabfiles and paves the way for task namespacing
  in the near future. See :ref:`fabfile-discovery` for details.
* :issue:`7`: `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo` now allow full
  interactivity with the remote end. You can now interact with remote prompts
  and similar interfaces, making certain tasks much easier, and freeing you
  from the need to find noninteractive solutions if you don't want to. See
  :doc:`/usage/interactivity` for more on these changes.


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

The below changes are **backwards incompatible** and have the potential to
break your 0.9.x based fabfiles!

* `~fabric.contrib.files.contains` and `~fabric.contrib.files.append`
  previously had the ``filename`` argument in the second position, whereas all
  other functions in the `contrib.files <fabric.contrib.files>` module had
  ``filename`` as the first argument.  These two functions have been brought in
  line with the rest of the module.
* `~fabric.contrib.files.sed` now escapes single-quotes and parentheses in
  addition to forward slashes, in its ``before`` and ``after`` kwargs. Related
  to, but not entirely contained within, :issue:`159`.
* The ``user`` and ``pty`` kwargs in `~fabric.operations.sudo`'s signature have
  had their order swapped around to more closely match
  `~fabric.operations.run`.
* As part of the changes made in :issue:`7`, `~fabric.operations.run` and
  `~fabric.operations.sudo` have had the default value of their ``pty`` kwargs
  changed from ``False`` to ``True``. This, plus the addition of the
  :ref:`combine-stderr` kwarg/env var, may result in significant behavioral
  changes in remote programs which operate differently when attached to a tty.
* :issue:`61`: `~fabric.operations.put` and `~fabric.operations.get` now honor
  the remote current-working-directory changes applied by
  `~fabric.context_managers.cd`. Previously they would always treat relative
  remote paths as being relative to the remote home directory.
* :issue:`121`: `~fabric.operations.put` will no longer automatically attempt
  to mirror local file modes. Instead, you'll need to specify
  ``mirror_local_mode=True`` to get this behavior.
* :issue:`221`: `~fabric.decorators.runs_once` now memoizes the wrapped task's
  return value and returns that value on subsequent invocations, instead of
  returning None. Thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss and Travis Swicegood for catch +
  patch.

Feature additions
=================

* Prerelease versions of Fabric (starting with the 1.0 prereleases) will now
  print the Git SHA1 hash of the current checkout, if the user is working off
  of a Git clone of the Fabric source code repository.
* Added `~fabric.context_managers.path` context manager for modifying commands'
  effective ``$PATH``.
* Added convenience ``.succeeded`` attribute to the return values of
  `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo`/`~fabric.operations.local`
  which is simply the opposite of the ``.failed`` attribute.
* Refactored SSH disconnection code out of the main ``fab`` loop into
  `~fabric.network.disconnect_all`, allowing library users to avoid problems
  with non-fabfile Python scripts hanging after execution finishes.
* `~fabric.operations.local` now honors `~fabric.context_managers.cd`.
* :issue:`2`: Added ``use_sudo`` kwarg to `~fabric.operations.put` to allow
  uploading of files to privileged locations. Thanks to Erich Heine and IRC
  user ``npmap`` for suggestions and patches.
* :issue:`23`: Added `~fabric.context_managers.prefix` context manager for
  easier management of persistent state across commands.
* :issue:`27`: Added environment variable (:ref:`always-use-pty`) and
  command-line flag (:option:`--no-pty`) for global control over the
  `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo` ``pty`` argument.
* :issue:`55`: `~fabric.operations.run`, `~fabric.operations.sudo` and
  `~fabric.operations.local` now provide access to their standard error
  (stderr) as an attribute on the return value, alongside e.g. ``.failed``.
* :issue:`148`: `~fabric.operations.local` now returns the same "rich" string
  object as `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo` do, so that it
  is a string containing the command's stdout (if ``capture=True``) or the
  empty string (if ``capture=False``) which exposes the ``.failed`` and
  ``.return_code`` attributes, and so forth.
* :issue:`151`: Added a `~fabric.utils.puts` utility function, which allows
  greater control over fabfile-generated (as opposed to Fabric-generated)
  output. Also added `~fabric.utils.fastprint`, an alias to
  `~fabric.utils.puts` allowing for convenient unbuffered,
  non-newline-terminated printing.
* :issue:`192`: Added per-user/host password cache to assist in
  multi-connection scenarios.
* :issue:`193`: When requesting a remote pseudo-terminal, use the invoking
  terminal's dimensions instead of going with the default.
