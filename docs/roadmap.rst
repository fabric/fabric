Development roadmap
===================

This document outlines Fabric's intended development path. Please make sure
you're reading `the latest version
<http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/roadmap.html>`_ of this document! 

.. warning::
    This information is subject to change without warning, and should not be
    used as a basis for any life- or career-altering decisions!


Near-term feature releases and support work
===========================================

* Move non-code-related docs to a new static site on ``www.fabfile.org``
  (:issue:`419`).
* Fabric **1.4**: Network-related improvements, such as an option for skipping
  or retrying unreachable or otherwise "bad" hosts (:issue:`8`, :issue:`348`,
  :issue:`249`) and SSH key changes (:issue:`72`, :issue:`150`.)
* Work on a new (to us; probably hacking an existing codebase) GitHub-focused
  IRC bot (:issue:`169`).
* Fabric **1.5**: Logging integration (:issue:`57`) and other UI tweaks,
  possibly including colored output (:issue:`101`) by default.


Longer-term but probably still 1.x plans
========================================

In no particular order, some potential future feature releases:

* Work on our fork of Paramiko, ``ssh``, to fix `a number of outstanding
  issues/deficiencies <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/275>`_ that
  cause problems for Fabric itself (authentication failure reasons being
  unclear, lack of SSH agent forwarding and/or gateway support, etc.)
* Improved object-oriented design, both internal refactoring and at the API
  level (for example, ``Host`` objects as an alternative to host strings.)


Fabric 2.0
==========

* As a lead-in, any additional 1.x-compatible internal refactorings or API
  add-ons, such as aforementioned OO design patterns. Get as much done as
  possible without breaking backwards compatibility.
* Make decisions about what old ways of doing things should be axed in 2.0, or
  which can be easily "wrapped" in newer mechanisms without requiring lots of
  legacy code.
* Any other 2.x-marked tickets introducing new, clearly-backwards-incompatible
  features (`see list <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues?labels=2.x>`_.)
