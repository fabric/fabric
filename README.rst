I really love fabric's api for the subprocess module for executing local commands, but there are times when
I don't need the remote execution.  I also, really wanted to use fabric with python3.
This fork is an attempt to achieve that.



Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install fabric-swatch
