Community
=========

Fabric is a pretty new project and the community is small but growing.


Mailing list
------------

The primary means of communication is the fab-user mailing list. Although it is
called "fab-user", this list is also used by developers and contributors.
The fab-user list is also where new releases are announced and future releases
planned. The Fabric project does not yet have a mailing list dedicated to
developers and contributors.

The fab-user mailing list can be reached from [here][fab-user]. Registration
is required before you can post. This precaution is to keep out spam.


Site-seeing
-----------

Fabric, as a project, is featured on a number of different web sites for
various purposes. The most notable are listed here:

* **[Project Home](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/fab/)** <br />
This is the home-base for the Fabric project. Not terribly much to see,
though.

* **[Github Repository](http://github.com/karmazilla/fabric/)** <br />
