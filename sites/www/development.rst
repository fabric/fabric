Development
===========

The Fabric development team is headed by `Jeff Forcier
<http://bitprophet.org>`_, aka ``bitprophet``.  However, dozens of other
developers pitch in by submitting patches and ideas via `GitHub issues and pull
requests <https://github.com/fabric/fabric>`_, :ref:`IRC <irc>` or the `mailing
list <https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fab-user>`_.

Get the code
============

Please see the :ref:`source-code-checkouts` section of the :doc:`installing`
page for details on how to obtain Fabric's source code.

Contributing
============

There are a number of ways to get involved with Fabric:

* **Use Fabric and send us feedback!** This is both the easiest and arguably
  the most important way to improve the project -- let us know how you
  currently use Fabric and how you want to use it. (Please do try to search the
  `ticket tracker`_ first, though,
  when submitting feature ideas.)
* **Report bugs or submit feature requests.** We follow `contribution-guide.org
  <https://www.contribution-guide.org>`_'s guidelines, so please check them out before
  visiting the `ticket tracker`_.

.. _ticket tracker: https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues

While we may not always reply promptly, we do try to make time eventually to
inspect all contributions and either incorporate them or explain why we don't
feel the change is a good fit.


Support of older releases
=========================

Major and minor releases do not usually mark the end of the previous line or
lines of development:

* Recent minor release branches typically continue to receive critical
  bugfixes, often extending back two or three release lines (so e.g. if 2.4 was
  the currently active release line, 2.3 and perhaps even 2.2 might get
  patches).
* Depending on the nature of bugs found and the difficulty in backporting them,
  older release lines may also continue to get bugfixes -- but there's no
  guarantee of any kind. Thus, if a bug were found in 2.4 that affected 2.1 and
  could be easily applied, a new 2.1.x version *might* be released.
