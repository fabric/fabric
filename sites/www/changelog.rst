=========

.. note::
    Looking for the Fabric 1.x changelog? See :doc:`/changelog-v1`.

- :feature:`-` Added parmiko's callback parameters for sftp get and put
   operations, allowing to get progress information.
- :feature:`-` Forward local terminal resizes to the remote end, when
  applicable. (For the technical: this means we now turn ``SIGWINCH`` into SSH
  ``window-change`` messages.)
- :bug:`2142 major` Update `~fabric.connection.Connection` temporarily so that
  it doesn't incidentally apply ``replace_env=True`` to local shell commands,
  only remote ones. On Windows under Python 3.7+, this was causing local
  commands to fail due to lack of some environment variables. Future updates
  will cleanly separate the config tree for remote vs local methods.

  Thanks to Bartosz Lachowicz for the report and David JM Emmett for the patch.
- :release:`2.6.0 <2021-01-18>`
- :bug:`- major` Fix a handful of issues in the handling and
  mocking of SFTP local paths and ``os.path`` members within
  :ref:`fabric.testing <testing-subpackage>`; this should remove some
  occasional "useless Mocks" as well as hewing closer to the real behavior of
  things like ``os.path.abspath`` re: path normalization.
- :feature:`-` When the ``local`` path argument to
  `Transfer.get <fabric.transfer.Transfer.get>` contains nonexistent
  directories, they are now created instead of raising an error.

  .. warning::
    This change introduces a new runtime dependency: ``pathlib2``.

- :feature:`1868` Ported a feature from v1: interpolating the local path
  argument in  `Transfer.get <fabric.transfer.Transfer.get>` with connection
  and remote filepath attributes.

  For example, ``cxn.get(remote="/var/log/foo.log", local="{host}/")`` is now
  feasible for storing a file in per-host-named directories or files, and in
  fact `Group.get <fabric.group.Group.get>` does this by default.
- :feature:`1810` Add `put <fabric.group.Group.put>`/`get
  <fabric.group.Group.get>` support to `~fabric.group.Group`.
- :feature:`1999` Add `sudo <fabric.group.Group.sudo>` support to
  `~fabric.group.Group`. Thanks to Bonnie Hardin for the report and to Winston
  Nolan for an early patchset.
- :release:`2.5.0 <2019-08-06>`
- :support:`-` Update minimum Invoke version requirement to ``>=1.3``.
- :feature:`1985` Add support for explicitly closing remote subprocess' stdin
  when local stdin sees an EOF, by implementing a new command-runner method
  recently added to Invoke; this prevents remote programs that 'follow' stdin
  from blocking forever.
- :bug:`- major` Anonymous/'remainder' subprocess execution (eg ``fab -H host
  -- command``, as opposed to the use of `Connection.run
  <fabric.connection.Connection.run>` inside tasks) was explicitly specifying
  ``in_stream=False`` (i.e. "disconnect from stdin") under the hood; this was
  leftover from early development and prevented use of interactive (or other
  stdin-reading) programs via this avenue.

  It has been removed; ``cat 'text' | fab -H somehost -- reads-from-stdin`` (or
  similar use cases) should work again.
- :support:`-` Removed unnecessary Cryptography version pin from packaging
  metadata; this was an artifact from early development. At this point in
  time, only Paramiko's own direct dependency specification should matter.

  This is unlikely to affect anybody's install, since Paramiko has required
  newer Cryptography versions for a number of years now.
- :feature:`-` Allow specifying connection timeouts (already available via
  `~fabric.connection.Connection` constructor argument and configuration
  option) on the command-line, via :option:`-t/--connect-timeout <-t>`.
- :feature:`1989` Reinstate command timeouts, by supporting the implementation
  of that feature in Invoke (`pyinvoke/invoke#539
  <https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke/issues/539>`_). Thanks to Israel Fruchter
  for report and early patchset.
- :release:`2.4.0 <2018-09-13>`
- :release:`2.3.2 <2018-09-13>`
- :release:`2.2.3 <2018-09-13>`
- :release:`2.1.6 <2018-09-13>`
- :release:`2.0.5 <2018-09-13>`
- :feature:`1849` Add `Connection.from_v1
  <fabric.connection.Connection.from_v1>` (and `Config.from_v1
  <fabric.config.Config.from_v1>`) for easy creation of modern
  ``Connection``/``Config`` objects from the currently configured Fabric 1.x
  environment. Should make upgrading piecemeal much easier for many use cases.
- :feature:`1780` Add context manager behavior to `~fabric.group.Group`, to
  match the same feature in `~fabric.connection.Connection`. Feature request by
  István Sárándi.
- :feature:`1709` Add `Group.close <fabric.group.Group.close>` to allow closing
  an entire group's worth of connections at once. Patch via Johannes Löthberg.
- :bug:`-` Fix a bug preventing tab completion (using the Invoke-level
  ``--complete`` flag) from completing task names correctly (behavior was to
  act as if there were never any tasks present, even if there was a valid
  fabfile nearby).
- :bug:`1850` Skip over ``ProxyJump`` configuration directives in SSH config
  data when they would cause self-referential ``RecursionError`` (e.g. due to
  wildcard-using ``Host`` stanzas which include the jump server itself).
  Reported by Chris Adams.
- :bug:`-` Some debug logging was reusing Invoke's logger object, generating
  log messages "named" after ``invoke`` instead of ``fabric``. This has been
  fixed by using Fabric's own logger everywhere instead.
- :bug:`1852` Grant internal `~fabric.connection.Connection` objects created
  during ``ProxyJump`` based gateways/proxies a copy of the outer
  ``Connection``'s configuration object. This was not previously done, which
  among other things meant one could not fully disable SSH config file loading
  (as the internal ``Connection`` objects would revert to the default
  behavior). Thanks to Chris Adams for the report.
- :release:`2.3.1 <2018-08-08>`
- :bug:`- (2.3+)` Update the new functionality added for :issue:`1826` so it
  uses ``export``; without this, nontrivial shell invocations like ``command1
  && command2`` end up only applying the env vars to the first command.
- :release:`2.3.0 <2018-08-08>`
- :feature:`1826` Add a new Boolean configuration and
  `~fabric.connection.Connection` parameter, ``inline_ssh_env``, which (when
  set to ``True``) changes how Fabric submits shell environment variables to
  remote servers; this feature helps work around commonly restrictive
  ``AcceptEnv`` settings on SSH servers. Thanks to Massimiliano Torromeo and
  Max Arnold for the reports.
- :release:`2.2.2 <2018-07-31>`
- :release:`2.1.5 <2018-07-31>`
- :release:`2.0.4 <2018-07-31>`
- :bug:`-` Implement ``__lt__`` on `~fabric.connection.Connection` so it can be
  sorted; this was overlooked when implementing things like ``__eq__`` and
  ``__hash__``. (No, sorting doesn't usually matter much for this object type,
  but when you gotta, you gotta...)
- :support:`1819 backported` Moved example code from the README into the Sphinx
  landing page so that we could apply doctests; includes a bunch of corrections
  to invalid example code! Thanks to Antonio Feitosa for the initial catch &
  patch.
- :bug:`1749` Improve `~fabric.transfer.Transfer.put` behavior when uploading
  to directory (vs file) paths, which was documented as working but had not
  been fully implemented. The local path's basename (or file-like objects'
  ``.name`` attribute) is now appended to the remote path in this case. Thanks
  to Peter Uhnak for the report.
- :feature:`1831` Grant `~fabric.group.Group` (and subclasses) the ability to
  take arbitrary keyword arguments and pass them onto the internal
  `~fabric.connection.Connection` constructors. This allows code such as::

    mygroup = Group('host1', 'host2', 'host3', user='admin')

  which was previously impossible without manually stuffing premade
  ``Connection`` objects into `Group.from_connections
  <fabric.group.Group.from_connections>`.
- :bug:`1762` Fix problem where lower configuration levels' setting of
  ``connect_kwargs.key_filename`` were being overwritten by the CLI
  ``--identity`` flag's value...even when that value was the empty list.
  CLI-given values are supposed to win, but not quite that hard. Reported by
  ``@garu57``.
- :support:`1653 backported` Clarify `~fabric.transfer.Transfer` API docs
  surrounding remote file paths, such as the lack of tilde expansion (a buggy
  and ultimately unnecessary v1 feature). Thanks to ``@pint12`` for bringing it
  up.
- :release:`2.2.1 <2018-07-18>`
- :bug:`1824` The changes implementing :issue:`1772` failed to properly account
  for backwards compatibility with Invoke-level task objects. This has been
  fixed; thanks to ``@ilovezfs`` and others for the report.
- :release:`2.2.0 <2018-07-13>`
- :release:`2.1.4 <2018-07-13>`
- :release:`2.0.3 <2018-07-13>`
- :bug:`-` The `fabric.testing.fixtures.remote` pytest fixture was found to not
  be properly executing expectation/sanity tests on teardown; this was an
  oversight and has been fixed.
- :support:`-` Updated the minimum required Invoke version to ``1.1``.
- :feature:`1772` ``@hosts`` is back -- as a `@task <fabric.tasks.task>`/`Task
  <fabric.tasks.Task>` parameter of the same name. Acts much like a per-task
  :option:`--hosts`, but can optionally take dicts of
  `fabric.connection.Connection` kwargs as well as the typical shorthand host
  strings.

  .. note::
    As of this change, we are now recommending the use of the
    new-in-this-release Fabric-level `@task <fabric.tasks.task>`/`Task
    <fabric.tasks.Task>` objects instead of their Invoke counterparts, even if
    you're not using the ``hosts`` kwarg -- it will help future-proof your code
    for similar feature-adds later, and generally be less confusing than having
    mixed Invoke/Fabric imports for these object types.

- :feature:`1766` Reinstate support for use as ``python -m fabric``, which (as
  in v1) now behaves identically to invoking ``fab``. Thanks to
  ``@RupeshPatro`` for the original patchset.
- :bug:`1753` Set one of our test modules to skip user/system SSH config file
  loading by default, as it was too easy to forget to do so for tests aimed at
  related functionality. Reported by Chris Rose.
- :release:`2.1.3 <2018-05-24>`
- :bug:`-` Our packaging metadata lacked a proper ``MANIFEST.in`` and thus some
  distributions were not including ancillary directories like tests and
  documentation. This has been fixed.
- :bug:`-` Our ``packages=`` argument to ``setuptools.setup`` was too specific
  and did not allow for subpackages...such as the newly added
  ``fabric.testing``. Fixed now.
- :release:`2.1.2 <2018-05-24>`
- :bug:`-` Minor fix to ``extras_require`` re: having ``fabric[pytest]``
  encompass the contents of ``fabric[testing]``.
- :release:`2.1.1 <2018-05-24>`
- :bug:`-` Somehow neglected to actually add ``extras_require`` to our
  ``setup.py`` to enable ``pip install fabric[testing]`` et al. This has been
  fixed. We hope.
- :release:`2.1.0 <2018-05-24>`
- :release:`2.0.2 <2018-05-24>`
- :feature:`-` Exposed our previously internal test helpers for use by
  downstream test suites, as the :ref:`fabric.testing <testing-subpackage>`
  subpackage.

  .. note::
    As this code requires non-production dependencies, we've also updated our
    packaging metadata to publish some setuptools "extras", ``fabric[testing]``
    (base) and ``fabric[pytest]`` (for pytest users).

- :support:`1761 backported` Integration tests were never added to Travis or
  ported to pytest before 2.0's release; this has been addressed.
- :support:`1759 backported` Apply the ``black`` code formatter to the codebase
  and engage it on Travis-CI. Thanks to Chris Rose.
- :support:`1745 backported` Wrap any imports of ``invoke.vendor.*`` with
  ``try``/``except`` such that downstream packages which have removed
  ``invoke.vendor`` are still able to function by using stand-alone
  dependencies. Patch courtesy of Othmane Madjoudj.
- :release:`2.0.1 <2018-05-14>`
- :bug:`1740` A Python 3 wheel was not uploaded during the previous release as
  expected; it turned out we were lacking the typical 'build universal wheels'
  setting in our ``setup.cfg`` (due to copying it from the one other project in
  our family of projects which explicitly cannot build universal wheels!) This
  has been fixed and a proper universal wheel is now built.
- :release:`2.0.0 <2018-05-08>`
- :feature:`-` Rewrite for 2.0! See :ref:`upgrading`.
