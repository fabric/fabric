# These requirements are for DEVELOPMENT ONLY!
# You do not need e.g. Sphinx or Fudge just to run the 'fab' tool.
# Instead, these are necessary for executing the test suite or developing the
# cutting edge (which may have different requirements from released versions.)

# Development version of Paramiko, just in case we're in one of those phases.
-e git+https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko#egg=paramiko
# Pull in actual "you already have local installed checkouts of Fabric +
# Paramiko" dev deps.
