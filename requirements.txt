# You do not need e.g. Sphinx or Fudge just to run the 'fab' tool.
# Instead, these are necessary for executing the test suite.

# PLEASE NOTE: due to how Pip currently works, you will need to manually
# execute "pip install Mercurial" before using this file. Otherwise it will
# bail out upon trying to install Fudge from BitBucket.
