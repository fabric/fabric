    Prompt user with ``text`` and return the input (like ``raw_input``).

    A single space character will be appended for convenience, but nothing
    else. Thus, you may want to end your prompt text with a question mark or a
    colon, e.g. ``prompt("What hostname?")``.

    If ``key`` is given, the user's input will be stored as ``env.<key>`` in
    addition to being returned by `prompt`. If the key already existed in
    ``env``, its value will be overwritten and a warning printed to the user.

    If ``default`` is given, it is displayed in square brackets and used if the
    user enters nothing (i.e. presses Enter without entering any text).
    ``default`` defaults to the empty string. If non-empty, a space will be
    appended, so that a call such as ``prompt("What hostname?",
    default="foo")`` would result in a prompt of ``What hostname? [foo]`` (with
    a trailing space after the ``[foo]``.)

    The optional keyword argument ``validate`` may be a callable or a string:

    * If a callable, it is called with the user's input, and should return the
      value to be stored on success. On failure, it should raise an exception
      with an exception message, which will be printed to the user.
    * If a string, the value passed to ``validate`` is used as a regular
      expression. It is thus recommended to use raw strings in this case. Note
      that the regular expression, if it is not fully matching (bounded by
      ``^`` and ``$``) it will be made so. In other words, the input must fully
      match the regex.

    Either way, `prompt` will re-prompt until validation passes (or the user
    hits ``Ctrl-C``).

    .. note::
        `~fabric.operations.prompt` honors :ref:`env.abort_on_prompts
        <abort-on-prompts>` and will call `~fabric.utils.abort` instead of

def put(local_path=None, remote_path=None, use_sudo=False,
    mirror_local_mode=False, mode=None):
    """
    Upload one or more files to a remote host.

    `~fabric.operations.put` returns an iterable containing the absolute file
    paths of all remote files uploaded. This iterable also exhibits a
    ``.failed`` attribute containing any local file paths which failed to
    upload (and may thus be used as a boolean test.) You may also check
    ``.succeeded`` which is equivalent to ``not .failed``.

    ``local_path`` may be a relative or absolute local file or directory path,
    and may contain shell-style wildcards, as understood by the Python ``glob``
    module.  Tilde expansion (as implemented by ``os.path.expanduser``) is also
    performed.

    ``local_path`` may alternately be a file-like object, such as the result of
    ``open('path')`` or a ``StringIO`` instance.

    .. note::
        In this case, `~fabric.operations.put` will attempt to read the entire
        contents of the file-like object by rewinding it using ``seek`` (and
        will use ``tell`` afterwards to preserve the previous file position).

    .. note::
        Use of a file-like object in `~fabric.operations.put`'s ``local_path``
        argument will cause a temporary file to be utilized due to limitations
        in our SSH layer's API.

    ``remote_path`` may also be a relative or absolute location, but applied to
    the remote host. Relative paths are relative to the remote user's home
    directory, but tilde expansion (e.g. ``~/.ssh/``) will also be performed if
    necessary.

    An empty string, in either path argument, will be replaced by the
    appropriate end's current working directory.

    While the SFTP protocol (which `put` uses) has no direct ability to upload
    files to locations not owned by the connecting user, you may specify
    ``use_sudo=True`` to work around this. When set, this setting causes `put`
    to upload the local files to a temporary location on the remote end, and
    then use `sudo` to move them to ``remote_path``.

    In some use cases, it is desirable to force a newly uploaded file to match
    the mode of its local counterpart (such as when uploading executable
    scripts). To do this, specify ``mirror_local_mode=True``.

    Alternately, you may use the ``mode`` kwarg to specify an exact mode, in
    the same vein as ``os.chmod`` or the Unix ``chmod`` command.

    `~fabric.operations.put` will honor `~fabric.context_managers.cd`, so
    relative values in ``remote_path`` will be prepended by the current remote
    working directory, if applicable. Thus, for example, the below snippet
    would attempt to upload to ``/tmp/files/test.txt`` instead of
    ``~/files/test.txt``::

        with cd('/tmp'):
            put('/path/to/local/test.txt', 'files')

    Use of `~fabric.context_managers.lcd` will affect ``local_path`` in the
    same manner.

    Examples::

        put('bin/project.zip', '/tmp/project.zip')
        put('*.py', 'cgi-bin/')
        put('index.html', 'index.html', mode=0755)

        `~fabric.context_managers.cd`, and the local working directory as
        manipulated by `~fabric.context_managers.lcd`.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.0
        Now allows file-like objects in the ``local_path`` argument.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.0
        Directories may be specified in the ``local_path`` argument and will
        trigger recursive uploads.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.0

        also exhibits the ``.failed`` and ``.succeeded`` attributes.

    """
    Download one or more files from a remote host.

    `~fabric.operations.get` returns an iterable containing the absolute paths
    to all local files downloaded, which will be empty if ``local_path`` was a
    StringIO object (see below for more on using StringIO). This object will
    also exhibit a ``.failed`` attribute containing any remote file paths which
    failed to download, and a ``.succeeded`` attribute equivalent to ``not
    .failed``.

    ``remote_path`` is the remote file or directory path to download, which may
    contain shell glob syntax, e.g. ``"/var/log/apache2/*.log"``, and will have
    tildes replaced by the remote home directory. Relative paths will be
    considered relative to the remote user's home directory, or the current
    remote working directory as manipulated by `~fabric.context_managers.cd`.
    If the remote path points to a directory, that directory will be downloaded
    recursively.

    ``local_path`` is the local file path where the downloaded file or files
    will be stored. If relative, it will honor the local current working
    directory as manipulated by `~fabric.context_managers.lcd`. It may be
    interpolated, using standard Python dict-based interpolation, with the
    following variables:

    * ``host``: The value of ``env.host_string``, eg ``myhostname`` or
      ``user@myhostname-222`` (the colon between hostname and port is turned
      into a dash to maximize filesystem compatibility)
    * ``dirname``: The directory part of the remote file path, e.g. the
      ``src/projectname`` in ``src/projectname/utils.py``.
    * ``basename``: The filename part of the remote file path, e.g. the
      ``utils.py`` in ``src/projectname/utils.py``
    * ``path``: The full remote path, e.g. ``src/projectname/utils.py``.

    .. note::
        When ``remote_path`` is an absolute directory path, only the inner
        directories will be recreated locally and passed into the above
        variables. So for example, ``get('/var/log', '%(path)s')`` would start
        writing out files like ``apache2/access.log``,
        ``postgresql/8.4/postgresql.log``, etc, in the local working directory.
        It would **not** write out e.g.  ``var/log/apache2/access.log``.

        Additionally, when downloading a single file, ``%(dirname)s`` and
        ``%(path)s`` do not make as much sense and will be empty and equivalent
        to ``%(basename)s``, respectively. Thus a call like
        ``get('/var/log/apache2/access.log', '%(path)s')`` will save a local
        file named ``access.log``, not ``var/log/apache2/access.log``.

        This behavior is intended to be consistent with the command-line
        ``scp`` program.

    If left blank, ``local_path`` defaults to ``"%(host)s/%(path)s"`` in order
    to be safe for multi-host invocations.

    .. warning::
        If your ``local_path`` argument does not contain ``%(host)s`` and your
        `~fabric.operations.get` call runs against multiple hosts, your local
        files will be overwritten on each successive run!

    If ``local_path`` does not make use of the above variables (i.e. if it is a
    simple, explicit file path) it will act similar to ``scp`` or ``cp``,
    overwriting pre-existing files if necessary, downloading into a directory
    if given (e.g. ``get('/path/to/remote_file.txt', 'local_directory')`` will
    create ``local_directory/remote_file.txt``) and so forth.

    ``local_path`` may alternately be a file-like object, such as the result of
    ``open('path', 'w')`` or a ``StringIO`` instance.

    .. note::
        Attempting to `get` a directory into a file-like object is not valid
        and will result in an error.

    .. note::
        This function will use ``seek`` and ``tell`` to overwrite the entire
        contents of the file-like object, in order to be consistent with the
        behavior of `~fabric.operations.put` (which also considers the entire
        file). However, unlike `~fabric.operations.put`, the file pointer will
        not be restored to its previous location, as that doesn't make as much

    This function is most useful for when you need to interact with a heavily
    shell-based command or series of commands, such as when debugging or when

    It should be considered an easy way to work an interactive shell session
    into the middle of a Fabric script and is *not* a drop-in replacement for
    `~fabric.operations.run`, which is also capable of interacting with the
    remote end (albeit only while its given command is executing) and has much
    stronger programmatic abilities such as error handling and stdout/stderr
    capture.

    Specifically, `~fabric.operations.open_shell` provides a better interactive
    experience than `~fabric.operations.run`, but use of a full remote shell
    prevents Fabric from determining whether programs run within the shell have
    failed, and pollutes the stdout/stderr stream with shell output such as
    login banners, prompts and echoed stdin.

def run(command, shell=True, pty=True, combine_stderr=None):
    """
    Run a shell command on a remote host.

    If ``shell`` is True (the default), `run` will execute the given command
    string via a shell interpreter, the value of which may be controlled by
    setting ``env.shell`` (defaulting to something similar to ``/bin/bash -l -c
    "<command>"``.) Any double-quote (``"``) or dollar-sign (``$``) characters
    in ``command`` will be automatically escaped when ``shell`` is True.

    `run` will return the result of the remote program's stdout as a single
    (likely multiline) string. This string will exhibit ``failed`` and
    ``succeeded`` boolean attributes specifying whether the command failed or
    succeeded, and will also include the return code as the ``return_code``
    attribute.

    Any text entered in your local terminal will be forwarded to the remote
    program as it runs, thus allowing you to interact with password or other
    prompts naturally. For more on how this works, see
    :doc:`/usage/interactivity`.

    You may pass ``pty=False`` to forego creation of a pseudo-terminal on the
    remote end in case the presence of one causes problems for the command in
    question. However, this will force Fabric itself to echo any  and all input
    you type while the command is running, including sensitive passwords. (With
    ``pty=True``, the remote pseudo-terminal will echo for you, and will
    intelligently handle password-style prompts.) See :ref:`pseudottys` for
    details.

    Similarly, if you need to programmatically examine the stderr stream of the
    remote program (exhibited as the ``stderr`` attribute on this function's
    return value), you may set ``combine_stderr=False``. Doing so has a high
    chance of causing garbled output to appear on your terminal (though the
    resulting strings returned by `~fabric.operations.run` will be properly
    separated). For more info, please read :ref:`combine_streams`.

    Examples::

        run("ls /var/www/")

    capturing output, as `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo`

    capturing as necessary, and defaults to ``False``.

    When ``capture=False``, the local subprocess' stdout and stderr streams are
    hooked up directly to your terminal, though you may use the global
    :doc:`output controls </usage/output_controls>` ``output.stdout`` and
    ``output.stderr`` to hide one or both if desired. In this mode,
