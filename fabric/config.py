class Config(InvokeConfig):
    """
    An `invoke.config.Config` subclass with extra Fabric-related behavior.

    This class behaves like `invoke.config.Config` in every way, with the
    following exceptions:

    - its `global_defaults` staticmethod has been extended to add/modify some
      default settings (see its documentation, below, for details);
    - it triggers loading of Fabric-specific env vars (e.g.
      ``FABRIC_RUN_HIDE=true`` instead of ``INVOKE_RUN_HIDE=true``) and
      filenames (e.g. ``/etc/fabric.yaml`` instead of ``/etc/invoke.yaml``).
    - it extends the API to account for loading ``ssh_config`` files (which are
      stored as additional attributes and have no direct relation to the
      regular config data/hierarchy.)
    - it adds a new optional constructor, `from_v1`, which :ref:`generates
      configuration data from Fabric 1 <from-v1>`.

    Intended for use with `.Connection`, as using vanilla
    `invoke.config.Config` objects would require users to manually define
    ``port``, ``user`` and so forth.
