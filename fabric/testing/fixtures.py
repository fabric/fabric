`pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ fixtures for easy use of Fabric test helpers.

To get Fabric plus this module's dependencies (as well as those of the main
`fabric.testing.base` module which these fixtures wrap), ``pip install
fabric[pytest]``.

The simplest way to get these fixtures loaded into your test suite so Pytest
notices them is to import them into a ``conftest.py`` (`docs
<http://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixture.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixture-functions>`_).
For example, if you intend to use the `remote` and `client` fixtures::

    from fabric.testing.fixtures import client, remote

def client():
    """
    Mocks `~paramiko.client.SSHClient` for testing calls to ``connect()``.

    Yields a mocked ``SSHClient`` instance.

    This fixture updates `~paramiko.client.SSHClient.get_transport` to return a
    mock that appears active on first check, then inactive after, matching most
    tests' needs by default:

    - `.Connection` instantiates, with a None ``.transport``.
    - Calls to ``.open()`` test ``.is_connected``, which returns ``False`` when
      ``.transport`` is falsey, and so the first open will call
      ``SSHClient.connect`` regardless.
    - ``.open()`` then sets ``.transport`` to ``SSHClient.get_transport()``, so
      ``Connection.transport`` is effectively
      ``client.get_transport.return_value``.
    - Subsequent activity will want to think the mocked SSHClient is
      "connected", meaning we want the mocked transport's ``.active`` to be
      ``True``.
    - This includes `.Connection.close`, which short-circuits if
      ``.is_connected``; having a statically ``True`` active flag means a full
      open -> close cycle will run without error. (Only tests that double-close
      or double-open should have issues here.)

    End result is that:

    - ``.is_connected`` behaves False after instantiation and before ``.open``,
      then True after ``.open``
    - ``.close`` will work normally on 1st call
    - ``.close`` will behave "incorrectly" on subsequent calls (since it'll
      think connection is still live.) Tests that check the idempotency of
      ``.close`` will need to tweak their mock mid-test.

    For 'full' fake remote session interaction (i.e. stdout/err
    reading/writing, channel opens, etc) see `remote`.
