    """
    Synchronize a remote directory with the current project directory via rsync.

    Where ``upload_project()`` makes use of ``scp`` to copy one's entire
    project every time it is invoked, ``rsync_project()`` uses the ``rsync``
    command-line utility, which only transfers files newer than those on the
    remote end.

    ``rsync_project()`` is thus a simple wrapper around ``rsync``; for
    details on how ``rsync`` works, please see its manpage. ``rsync`` must be
    installed on both your local and remote systems in order for this operation
    to work correctly.

    This function makes use of Fabric's ``local()`` operation, and returns the
    output of that function call; thus it will return the stdout, if any, of
    the resultant ``rsync`` call.

    ``rsync_project()`` takes the following parameters:

    * ``remote_dir``: the only required parameter, this is the path to the
      directory on the remote server. Due to how ``rsync`` is implemented, the
      exact behavior depends on the value of ``local_dir``:

        * If ``local_dir`` ends with a trailing slash, the files will be
          dropped inside of ``remote_dir``. E.g.
          ``rsync_project("/home/username/project", "foldername/")`` will drop
          the contents of ``foldername`` inside of ``/home/username/project``.
        * If ``local_dir`` does **not** end with a trailing slash (and this
          includes the default scenario, when ``local_dir`` is not specified),
          ``remote_dir`` is effectively the "parent" directory, and a new
          directory named after ``local_dir`` will be created inside of it. So
          ``rsync_project("/home/username", "foldername")`` would create a new
          directory ``/home/username/foldername`` (if needed) and place the
          files there.

    * ``local_dir``: by default, ``rsync_project`` uses your current working
      directory as the source directory. This may be overridden by specifying
      ``local_dir``, which is a string passed verbatim to ``rsync``, and thus
      may be a single directory (``"my_directory"``) or multiple directories
      (``"dir1 dir2"``). See the ``rsync`` documentation for details.
    * ``exclude``: optional, may be a single string, or an iterable of strings,
      and is used to pass one or more ``--exclude`` options to ``rsync``.
    * ``delete``: a boolean controlling whether ``rsync``'s ``--delete`` option
      is used. If True, instructs ``rsync`` to remove remote files that no
      longer exist locally. Defaults to False.
    * ``extra_opts``: an optional, arbitrary string which you may use to pass
      custom arguments or options to ``rsync``.
    * ``ssh_opts``: Like ``extra_opts`` but specifically for the SSH options
      string (rsync's ``--rsh`` flag.)
    * ``capture``: Sent directly into an inner `~fabric.operations.local` call.

    Furthermore, this function transparently honors Fabric's port and SSH key
    settings. Calling this function when the current host string contains a
    nonstandard port, or when ``env.key_filename`` is non-empty, will use the
    specified port and/or SSH key filename(s).

    For reference, the approximate ``rsync`` command-line call that is
    constructed by this function is the following::

        rsync [--delete] [--exclude exclude[0][, --exclude[1][, ...]]] \\
            -pthrvz [extra_opts] <local_dir> <host_string>:<remote_dir>

        The ``ssh_opts`` keyword argument.

    Upload the current project to a remote system via ``tar``/``gzip``.

    ``local_dir`` specifies the local project directory to upload, and defaults
