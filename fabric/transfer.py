            Remote file to download.

            May be absolute, or relative to the remote working directory.

            .. note::
                Most SFTP servers set the remote working directory to the
                connecting user's home directory, and (unlike most shells) do
                *not* expand tildes (``~``).

                For example, instead of saying ``get("~/tmp/archive.tgz")``,
                say ``get("tmp/archive.tgz")``.

        :param local:
            Local path to store downloaded file in, or a file-like object.

            **If None or another 'falsey'/empty value is given** (the default),
            the remote file is downloaded to the current working directory (as
            seen by `os.getcwd`) using its remote filename.

            **If a string is given**, it should be a path to a local directory
            or file and is subject to similar behavior as that seen by common
            Unix utilities or OpenSSH's ``sftp`` or ``scp`` tools.

            For example, if the local path is a directory, the remote path's
            base filename will be added onto it (so ``get('foo/bar/file.txt',
            '/tmp/')`` would result in creation or overwriting of
            ``/tmp/file.txt``).

            .. note::
                When dealing with nonexistent file paths, normal Python file
                handling concerns come into play - for example, a ``local``
                path containing non-leaf directories which do not exist, will
                typically result in an `OSError`.

            **If a file-like object is given**, the contents of the remote file
            are simply written into it.

        :param bool preserve_mode:
            Whether to `os.chmod` the local file so it matches the remote
            file's mode (default: ``True``).

            optional callback function (form: func(int, int)) that accepts the bytes
            transferred so far and the total bytes to be transferred
