    It is useful for any situation where you wish to print text which might
    otherwise get buffered by Python's output buffering (such as within a
    processor intensive ``for`` loop). Since such use cases typically also
    require a lack of line endings (such as printing a series of dots to
    signify progress) it also omits the traditional newline by default.
