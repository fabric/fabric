class OpenSSHAuthStrategy(AuthStrategy):
    """
    Auth strategy that tries very hard to act like the OpenSSH client.

    .. warning::
        As of version 3.1, this class is **EXPERIMENTAL** and **incomplete**.
        It works best with passphraseless (eg ssh-agent) private key auth for
        now and will grow more features in future releases.

    For example, it accepts a `~paramiko.config.SSHConfig` and uses any
    relevant ``IdentityFile`` directives from that object, along with keys from
    your home directory and any local SSH agent. Keys specified at runtime are
    tried last, just as with ``ssh -i /path/to/key`` (this is one departure
    from the legacy/off-spec auth behavior observed in older Paramiko and
    Fabric versions).

    We explicitly do not document the full details here, because the point is
    to match the documented/observed behavior of OpenSSH. Please see the `ssh
    <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh>`_ and `ssh_config
    <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config>`_ man pages for more information.

    # Skimming openssh code (ssh.c and sshconnect2.c) gives us the following
    # behavior to crib from:
    # - parse cli (initializing identity_files if any given)
    # - parse user config, then system config _unless_ user gave cli config
    # path; this will also add to identity_files if any IdentityFile found
    # (after the CLI ones)
    # - lots of value init, string interpolation, etc
    # - if no other identity_files exist at this point, fill in the ~/.ssh/
    # defaults:
    #   - in order: rsa, dsa, ecdsa, ecdsa_sk, ed25519, xmss (???)
    # - initial connection (ssh_connect() - presumably handshake/hostkey/kex)
    # - load all identity_files (and any implicit certs of those)
    # - eventually runs pubkey_prepare() which, per its own comment,
    # loads/assembles key material in this order:
    #   - certs - config file, then cli, skipping any non-user (?) certs
    #   - agent keys that are also listed in the config file
    #   - agent keys _not_ listed in config files
    #   - non-agent config file keys (this seems like it includes cli and
    #   implicit defaults)
    #   - once list is assembled, drop anything not listed in configured pubkey
    #   algorithms list
    # - auth_none to get list of acceptable authmethods
    # - while-loops along that, or next returned, list of acceptable
    # authmethods, using a handler table, so eg a 'standard' openssh on both
    # ends might start with 'publickey,password,keyboard-interactive'; so it'll
    # try all pubkeys found above before eventually trying a password prompt,
    # and then if THAT fails, it will try kbdint call-and-response (similar to
    # password but where server sends you the prompt(s) it wants displayed)
