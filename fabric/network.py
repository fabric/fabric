    """
    Dict subclass allowing for caching of host connections/clients.

    This subclass does not offer any extra methods, but will intelligently
    create new client connections when keys are requested, or return previously
    created connections instead.

    Key values are the same as host specifiers throughout Fabric: optional
    username + ``@``, mandatory hostname, optional ``:`` + port number.
    Examples:

    * ``example.com`` - typical Internet host address.
    * ``firewall`` - atypical, but still legal, local host address.
    * ``user@example.com`` - with specific username attached.
    * ``bob@smith.org:222`` - with specific nonstandard port attached.

    When the username is not given, ``env.user`` is used. ``env.user``
    defaults to the currently running user at startup but may be overwritten by
    user code or by specifying a command-line flag.

    Note that differing explicit usernames for the same hostname will result in
    multiple client connections being made. For example, specifying
    ``user1@example.com`` will create a connection to ``example.com``, logged
    in as ``user1``; later specifying ``user2@example.com`` will create a new,
    2nd connection as ``user2``.

    The same applies to ports: specifying two different ports will result in
    two different connections to the same host being made. If no port is given,
    22 is assumed, so ``example.com`` is equivalent to ``example.com:22``.
