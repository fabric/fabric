class Executor(invoke.Executor):
    """
    `~invoke.executor.Executor` subclass which understands Fabric concepts.

    Designed to work in tandem with Fabric's `@task
    <fabric.tasks.task>`/`~fabric.tasks.Task`, and is capable of acting on
    information stored on the resulting objects -- such as default host lists.

    This class is written to be backwards compatible with vanilla Invoke-level
    tasks, which it simply delegates to its superclass.

    Please see the parent class' `documentation <invoke.executor.Executor>` for
    details on most public API members and object lifecycle.

        strings) or decorator arguments (may be strings or kwarg dicts) into
        kwargs suitable for creating Connection instances.

        Subclasses may wish to override or extend this to perform, for example,
