1   Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
9   make parallel submode work
11  add built-in help for built-in variables
    - and modes and submodes
13  reduce print & exit() statements to as few functions as possible
14  also comment internal/private functions, if only a little
15  figure out a way to do plugins
    - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins
16  get a better shell
21  automated test suite
22  find alternative to the deprecated 'execfile()'
    - compile() + eval() makes a combo worth considering (if it works in py3k).
25  turn fabric the module, into fabric the package
26  fix upload_website when new files are added
28  Grant more control over the output - e.g. hide 'run'/'sudo' lines
29  Allow more interactivity -- detect remote prompts and passthru to user
30  Update commands to store "local" scope of some kind, such as underscored
    helper methods which currently get stripped out entirely.
31  Figure out how to deal with the use of different @hosts lists when running
    more than one command in a single session.
32  Glob patterns on put() and download(), like put('*.html', 'to/some/path')
33  When imported instead of ran via 'fab' (and/or controllable via option),
    raise an exception instead of calling sys.exit().
34  Put in optional (or default w/ option) timeouts for operations.
